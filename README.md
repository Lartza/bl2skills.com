# Borderlands 2 skill calculator

This project was one of my first publicly-used websites. I am a big fan of the Borderlands franchise, and when Borderlands 2 came out, I really wanted a better skill calculator than the official one.

I put this together in, like, a week or so, using some assets from the original skill calculator and some high resolution character renders. I wanted something fully client-side with few or no external dependencies. I didn't know about Knockout or any similar tech so I stored the data in the DOM (!).

Please feel free to submit pull requests or even to fork this for your own uses.
